# latching-relay-true-bypass
Guitar pedal latching relay true bypass using ATTiny85 microcontroller & Panasonic TQ2-L latching relay. 

This is to be used with the Arduino platform as requires the library "bouncer 2" which can be downloaded through the arduino IDE. 

To flash the chips please follow this tutorial https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Program-an-Attiny85-From-an-Arduino-Uno/ 

ATTiny85 Datasheet https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet.pdf

Remember the pin out on the code matches not to the pins numbered on the chip but the ones starting with PB0, PB1... etc
